Current Plan
---

Math functions are currently being worked on in a local environment to avoid any issues with integration/so they can actually be tested. 

Flow: User inputs their data -> data added to the database -> user wants to look at forecasts -> user clicks on forecasts button -> math functions are used to calculate calculated fields and are stored as runtime variables -> forecasts are displayed once these are calculated and user can modify fields as-needed.
